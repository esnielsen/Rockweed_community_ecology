# Rockweed_community_ecology

Data and code used in the study to assess the foundational role of three rockweed species within California to inform restoration. This work is part of the Anthony LaFetra Research Fellowship with the Point Conception Institute and The Nature Conservancy. The repository has the following folders:

**Data**
Data obtained from [MARINe](https://marine.ucsc.edu/index.html). 


**Code**
1) site.maps.R = Code used to create Fig 1 with the sample sites per rockweed species.
2) XX = Code to get average percent cover per understory species, and calculate + plot Shannon diversity expotential, and species richness from plots per rockweed species.
3) spp.pres.corrs.R = Code to get species presence/absence across all sites and calculate Jaccard similarity between species presences of rockweeds and understory species (to determine overlap in distributions)
4) spp.cov.corr.R = Code to create Fig. 2, displaying regressions from understory species which have significant relationships in their % cover to the rockweed canopy % cover.
5) SR.SD.glms.R = Code to run the generalized linear models to test the effect of rockweed canopy cover on understory cover, richness and diversity. 
6) stab.glms.R = Code to run generalzied mixed models to test the effect of rockweed cover, rockweed stability, and understory richness on the stability of understory cover. 
7) perm.simper.R = Code to run PERMANOVA and SIMPER analyses to assess understory community changes between plots with high and low rockweed cover.
8) nmds.plots.R = Code to create Fig. 3, NMDS plots displaying changes in understory community structure within plots that have >70% change in rockweed cover over the 10 year period.
